            <h2>Why Smart Lighting Detection?</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where urban lighting intelligently adapts to human presence, creating safer communities while drastically reducing energy consumption. Through our AI-powered smart lighting detection system, we're transforming traditional street lighting into an intelligent network that serves both environmental and social needs.</p>
            
            <p>Traditional street lighting systems operate at full capacity regardless of usage, resulting in significant energy waste. Studies show that conventional street lights account for approximately 40% of cities' electricity consumption. Our smart lighting system can reduce this energy usage by 50-80%, depending on implementation and traffic patterns.</p>
        
            <p>Consider these facts:</p>

              <li>Traditional systems waste energy during low-traffic periods, especially between 11 PM and 5 AM</li>
